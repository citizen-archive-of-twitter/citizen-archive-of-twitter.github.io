This project began as a way to collect information about the ways Twitter is currently being preserved and archived. Starting with the Library of Congress' attempt to archive the entirety of Twitter, and its later admission that this was too much of an undertaking for even the Library to accomplish, I was curious about how other organizations, institutions, artists, internet users, etc are attempting to perform this same process. Conversations about how to best preserve Twitter mainly focus on archiving significant political tweets, the ethical and moral implications of preserving information without Twitter users' consent, and the technical skills, money, and other resources needed to complete such a task. While these factors are important to consider in order to provide a full view of Twitter as a dynamic platform worth preserving, I am approaching the issue of how to preserve Twitter by first focusing on its functionality as an informal mode of information sharing where conversations emerge in ways that are impossible offline. This understanding is key to any discussion of a Twitter archive, as its structure not only influences the way it can be preserved, but also speaks to the real-world effects that Twitter continues to have. Some of the best reporting is being done on Twitter, and through my research I found a lack of materials about the process of preserving this kind of work.

Ultimately I found that because of the gaps in current digital preservation strategies and the complexities of Twitter as a platform, the most interesting and effective preservation work on Twitter is happening on an individual level rather than through large organizations like the Library of Congress. Encouraging Twitter users themselves to collaborate and investigate how Twitter can be preserved highlights not only the important conversations happening online, but also how Twitter as a platform has become a space where these conversations can emerge and develop.

This catalog includes many different resources, such as Twitter accounts, academic and informal writing about Twitter preservation, and selected Twitter preservation projects. Together, these resources reveal the power of citizen-archiving in digital preservation work. Similar to the way information is produced and discussed on Twitter, this catalog is meant to be viewed in any order with no importance given to any specific type of source. The experience of being on Twitter is difficult to capture, and preserving a few tweets cannot accurately represent Twitter as a platform. While I lack the coding skills required to create an interactive archive of Twitter, I hope this website will serve as a resource to investigate digital preservation trends through a close examination of Twitter.
