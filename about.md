This project began as a way to collect information about the ways Twitter is currently being preserved and archived. Beginning with the Library of Congress' attempt to archive the entirety of Twitter, and its later admission that this was too much of an undertaking for even the Library to accomplish, I was curious about other organizations, institutions, artists, internet users, etc that are attempting to perform this same process. Conversations about how to best preserve Twitter mainly focus on archiving significant political tweets, the ethical and moral implications of preserving and publishing information without Twitter users' consent, and the technical skills, money, and other resources needed to complete such a task. While these lines of thinking are important to consider in order to provide a full understanding of Twitter as a dynamic platform worth preserving, I am approaching the issue of how to preserve Twitter by first focusing on its functionality as an informal mode of information sharing through which conversations emerge in ways that are impossible offline. This understanding is key to any discussion of a Twitter archive, as its structure influences the way it can be preserved. The experience of being on Twitter is difficult to capture, and preserving a few tweets cannot accurently represent Twitter as a platform.

This catalog includes many different resources, such as Twitter accounts, academic and informal writing about Twitter preservation, and selected Twitter preservation projects, in order to reveal the power of citizen-archiving in digital preservation work. It is meant to be viewed in any order. I hope this website will serve as a resource to investigate digital preservation trends through an examination of Twitter, and is constantly growing. Ultimately, I found that because of the gaps in current digital preservation strategies and the complexities of Twitter as a platform, the most interesting and effective preservation projects for Twitter are happening on an individual level, rather than through large organizations like the Library of Congress. Encouraging Twitter users themselves to collaborate and investigate how Twitter can be preserved highlights not only the important conversations happening online, but also how Twitter as a platform has become a space where these conversations can emerge and develop.
